\subsection*{Overview}

The objective of this lab is to introduce the concepts of forward and inverse problems by exploring the example of fitting a line to scattered data. We also want to develop some basic capabilities in Matlab, such as vector-matrix operations and plotting.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down the forward model $d_i = m_1 + m_2 x_i$ in schematic matrix form $\bd = \bG\bem$.

\vertgap
\vertgap

\item Run the script \verb+lab_linefit.m+ and identify the key parts of the code associated with the forward problem and the inverse problem. What is the Matlab syntax for $\bem^T$, $\bG\bem$, and $\bG^T\bd$?

\vertgap

\item How are the ``target'' (or ``true'') data generated?

\vertgap

\item What are the different ways in Matlab to compute the solution vector $\bem$? \\
(Type \verb+help \+ or \verb+help inv+ for details.)

\vertgap

\item How does the estimated model $\bem_{\rm est}$ compare with the target model $\bem_{\rm tar}$?

\vertgap

How does the standard deviation of the residuals compare with the assumed value of $\sigma$?

\vertgap

\item What does the histogram show? \\
How does it change if you increase the number of points to $10^5$? \\
How does it change if you set $\sigma = 0$?

\vertgap

\item Re-set \verb+ndata=50+ and $\sigma = 0.3$ and add one outlier to the simulated observations. This can be done by replacing the first observation point with a value that is $1000\sigma$ larger. What happens (and why)?

\vertgap

\pagebreak
\item Now comment out the outlier. Comment out the \verb+break+ statement, then run the last block of code. Make sure you understand what is being plotted and how it is calculated.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the dimension of model space?
\item Fill out the table below.
\item In the code, why is the operation \verb+res.*res+ used instead of \verb+res*res+, \verb+res'*res+, or \verb+res*res'+?
\end{itemize}

         & \verb+res+      &                &              \\ \hline
\bgamma(\bem)  & \verb+gammam+ & $2 \times n_g$ & gradient of misfit function \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\item Referring to the class notes ``Taylor series and least squares'' (\verb+notes_taylor.pdf+) compute the gradient $\bgamma(\bem)$ for the same grid of $\bem$ that was used to plot the misfit function.

Hint: one line of code (plus one line to initialize $\bgamma(\bem)$)

Matlab's \verb+gradient+ function will not help you here, since you need an exact evaluation of the gradient, whereas Matlab will provide a numerical gradient for a grid of pre-computed values.

\vertgap

\item Using the \verb+quiver+ command, superimpose the vector field $-\gamma(\bem)$ on the contour plot of the misfit function.

Set \verb+nx = 10+ so that the vector field is more visible. \\
Hint: This is one line of code. \\
What is the relationship between the contours of $F(\bem)$ and $\bgamma(\bem)$?

\vertgap

How does $\|\bgamma(\bem)\|$ vary with respect to $\bem_{\rm est}$? \\
% it gets larger 
Bonus: Use \verb+surf+ to plot $\|\bgamma(\bem)\|$. What shape is it?
% a cone

\vertgap

\item What is the dependence of the Hessian on the model, $\bH(\bem)$?
% Hessian does not depend on m

\vertgap

What does that imply about $F(\bem)$?
% it is strictly quadratic

%What does that imply about the forward model $\bg(\bem)$?

\end{enumerate}
