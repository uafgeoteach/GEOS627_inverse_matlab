\item {\bf Textbooks.} The required (R) and supplemental (S) textbooks are listed in the following table; bibliographic details are listed at the end of this syllabus. ``Software'' lists the software (if any) used in examples within each book. The Geophysical Institute's Mather library is located on the gound floor of the IARC/Akasofu building.

\cite{Tarantola2005} can be downloaded as a pdf from Tarantola's webpage. However, he writes: ``Here are the rules: i)~you are invited to download, view, and print the books; ii)~if you work in a commercial company, or in a rich institution (like a university in the developed world), and your plan is to use one of the books from time to time, please purchase it (links below).''

\item Journal articles assigned as reading will be available as PDFs via the UAF google drive. All students must access the drive with their \verb+alaska.edu+ email address.

\item Students will need computers for their homework. General-use computers in UAF labs will be made available to students if needed.

\item Matlab will be the primary computational program for the course.
Matlab is available via a UAF-wide license for graduate students and faculty.
Students are welcome to use alternative programs such as python for homework problems; however several labs and examples are in Matlab.

\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Course description.}

An inverse problem is a procedure by which observations or measurements are used with quantitative models to gain inferences about some underlying physical quantity or system. Inverse problems occur in all fields of natural sciences --- even something as simple as fitting a line to scattered data is an inverse problem. This course will provide a general framework, as well as general computational algorithms, for approaching inverse problems. The training should benefit all students in natural sciences who are seeking inferences from data.

{\em Catalog description}: An inverse problem uses observations to infer properties of an unknown physical model. One example is how seismometer recordings can be used to infer the location of an earthquake. This course covers inverse theory and methods for solving inverse problems, including numerous examples arising in the natural sciences. Topics include linear regression, method of least squares, discrete ill-posed inverse problems, estimation of uncertainties, iterative optimization, and probabilistic (Bayesian) and sampling approaches. Assignments and computational laboratory exercises require familiarity with linear algebra and computational tools such as Matlab. 

%A forward problem uses a model to make predictions; an inverse problem uses observations to infer properties of an unknown physical model.

This course covers inverse theory and methods for solving inverse problems, including numerous examples arising in the natural sciences. Topics include linear regression, method of least squares, discrete ill-posed inverse problems, estimation of uncertainties, iterative optimization, and probabilistic (Bayesian) and sampling approaches. Assignments require familiarity with linear algebra and computational tools such as Matlab.

\item {\bf Course goals.}

We will explore the ubiquitous realm of inverse problems in Earth sciences: how to use observations to make inferences about underlying physical quantities or processes. Our ultimate goal is to be able to recognize the fundamental components of an inverse problem --- measurements, model parameters, misfit function, forward model --- then to pose an approach to solving the problem, then solve the problem with computational algorithms. Concepts of inverse theory and parameter estimation are fundamental to all observational scientists, which includes most students in the natural sciences. During this course students should acquire both a philosphical and scientific appreciation for inverse methods and problems.

%We will explore the study of earthquakes and Earth's interior structure using seismological theories and algorithms. The underlying physical phenomenon we will examine is the seismic wavefield: the time-dependent, space-dependent elastic waves that originate at an earthquake source (for example, a fault slips) and propagate though the heterogeneous Earth structure, then are finally recorded as time series at seismometers on Earth's surface. Students will examine real seismic data and use computational models to estimate properties about earthquake source and Earth structure. Students will acquire practical, advanced seismological training that will prepare them for seismological investigrations in the future, whether in academic, industry, or government jobs.

%------------

\item {\bf Evaluation.}

\begin{enumerate}
%\item For students in the M.S. or Ph.D. program, you must receive a C (note: not C-) or higher for this course for it to count toward your degree requirements.

\item Grading is based on:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
5\% & Lab participation \\ \hline
80\% & Homework assignments \\ \hline
15\% & Individual final project \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
\item Overall course grades are based on the following:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
A & $x \ge 93$ & excellent performance:  \\
A-- & $90 \le x < 93$ & student demonstrates deep understanding of the subject \\ \hline
B+ & $87 \le x < 90$ & strong performance: \\ 
B  & $83 \le x < 87$ & student demonstrates strong understanding of the subject, \\ 
B-- & $80 \le x < 83$ & but the work lacks the depth and quality needed for an `A' \\ \hline
C+ & $77 \le x < 80$ & mediocre performance: \\
C  & $73 \le x < 77$ & student demonstrates comprehension of some \\
C-- & $70 \le x < 73$ & essential concepts only \\ \hline
D  & $60 \le x < 70$ & poor performance: \\ 
   &                 & student demonstrates poor comprehension of concepts \\ \hline
F  & $x < 60$ & Failure to complete work with 60\% quality \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
\item {\bf Final Project.} The final project will constitute 15\% of the course grade. The project will involve independent research into an inverse problem of the student's choice. It will require some computation and will be presented in the form of a written report, due on the last lecture class of the semester, and a short in-class presentation during the scheduled final exam. The report will be written in manuscript-submission style and format.
%, using the guidelines for {\em Geophysical Research Letters}.
Additional details, including project suggestions, will be provided by the instructor midway through the course.

%\item {\bf Case study discussions.} Each student will lead a discussion of a case study in a particular inverse problem.
%I will provide a list of suggested questions for discussion, as well as a list of potential topics to choose from.
%Each student must choose a topic that is different from his or her final project topic. Leading discussion will count toward half of the ``Attendance and participation'' category of the course grade.

\end{enumerate}

%------------
\item {\bf Support Services.}

The instructor is available by appointment for additional assistance outside session hours. UAF has many student support programs, including the Math Hotline (1-866-UAF-MATH; 1-866-6284) and the Math and Stat Lab in Chapman building (see \verb+www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/+ for hours and details).

%------------
\item {\bf Disabilities Services.}

The Office of Disability Services implements the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and it ensures that UAF students have equal access to the campus and course materials. The Geophysics Program will work with the Office of Disability Services (208 Whitaker, 474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities.
